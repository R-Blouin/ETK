# ETK
Render/bind .Net objects into Excel via Templates. Binding can be bi-directional (changes in Excel will affect underlying objects). 
Manage objects, rows, cells selections. Add decorators, dynamic menus, buttons, expander, etc ..., into your templates.


ETK is used since the mid of 2015 in production by one of the largest French asset manager. 
Some of its most sensitive applications used everyday are based on ETK to manage a large set of asset funds (from exposition checking to financial order executions). These applications are written without any vba code and mixe happily Wpf and Excel.
